## Hello world!

This is my first try at github!

The panoramic photos were shot in Knowlton Hall, home of 
the Knowlton School of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, 
and City and Regional Planning, at the Ohio State University, Columbus.

Panoramic photos were shot on the Canon D5 Mark II, merged in PTGUI Pro 10.0.16, 
retouched in Adobe Photoshop, and converted into interactive .html documents 
using Pano2VR 5.2.3. All photography copyright Tim Jacoby, 2014-2018.
